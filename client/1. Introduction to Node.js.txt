1. Introduction to Node.js

 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a platform that allows us to run JavaScript code on our computer.
it to create server-side applications, not just client-side webpages.


Installation and Setup

 we can go to the Node.js website, download the installer, and run it. It will guide us through the installation process step by step.
Once installed, we can use the Node.js command prompt or terminal to run JavaScript files on our computer.


Features

1. Asynchronous and Event Driven- the server never waits for the response of the API it will move to the next API. the event-driven mechanism is like a signal that something has happened, such as a user clicking a button or a file finishing downloading Node.js allows you to define functions (callbacks) that should be executed when certain events occur.

2. Ecosystem of modules - node.js has a vast support of modules like core modules, local modules, and third-party modules.
e.g. SMTP, bycrypt, fs, mongoose, etc. 

3. Fast - Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers the Google Chrome web browser. This makes it fast and efficient.


Use Cases

1. commonly used for web servers and APIs
2. Develop real-time applications like chat application games etc.
3. can be used in IoT.



2. Asynchronous Programming 

- Understanding Asynchronous Programming in Node.js
 Asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks to be executed at the same time, without blocking the execution of other tasks.
In Node.js, most I/O operations (such as reading from a file, making an HTTP request, or querying a database) are asynchronous by default.
we use async/await keywords to declare the function async and wait for the promises.

- Callback Functions:

Callback functions are a fundamental concept in asynchronous programming in Node.js.
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, which then invokes the callback function once a certain task or operation is completed.

3. Data Handling

   - Connecting to databases (e.g., MongoDB)
Node.js allows us to connect to various databases, both SQL and NoSQL. 

First, we need to install Mongoose and require it in our Node.js application.
Then, use the mongoose.connect() method to establish a connection to our MongoDB database.

- Performing CRUD Operations:

Define a Mongoose schema to represent the structure of the database.
Use the model's methods to perform CRUD operations like (create, read, update, delete).

4. Testing Node.js Applications

Testing APIs ensures functionality, reliability, and performance, helping to identify and resolve issues early in the development process.

Tools for API Testing-

1. postman - 
 postman is used for API testing.
 we can get the response while testing the API and even we can specify where the data has to be given (headers, query, parameter, etc).
 we can create a collection of APIs.

2. Swagger-
Swagger is an API specification framework (OpenAPI Specification) used for defining, documenting, and testing RESTful APIs.
swagger also provides a web-based interface to test the API.
we can use "Swagger YAML or JSON" to document  API endpoints, parameters, responses, and authentication requirements.
